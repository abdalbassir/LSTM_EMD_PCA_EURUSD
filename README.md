# LSTM-for-EURUSD-daily-prediction-
This is code for LSTM prediction using EURUSD daily data provided by oanda that uses, several technical indicators as input for the model 

In the Settings file, we set all the parameters for the denoising, features and lstm model.
All parameters could be altered from the settings file, coding have been put from a linux based system 
If User is running code from windows he should adjust file path accordingly in the settings file to run code correctly 

The user can directly run  `LSTMBasedStrategy` that takes all the parameters from the `Settings` file and produce the results in `./Cashe/Results`.

To ensure smooth running user could import projectEnvironment.yml file in anaconda and use this environemnt to run code
